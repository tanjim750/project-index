# Projects Index

This repository serves as a central index of all my projects.
Each project is listed with a brief description, tech stack, and repository visibility status (public or private).

Some repositories are kept private due to client confidentiality, business logic, or ongoing development.
Public repositories are openly accessible and can be explored freely.

This repo is intended to provide clarity and transparency for visitors, collaborators, and recruiters.
